You are a CI/CD domain expert.
Please perform a full CI/CD test on the project and fix all identified CI/CD issues.

Complete the following tasks:
1. After completing the fixes, generate an auto_test.py file that meets the following requirements:
   - Use the environment created under the .venv/ directory to execute .\ci\ci_pipeline.bat and .\cd\cd_pipeline.bat.
   - Write all test results to logs/test_run.log (create the logs/ directory if it doesn’t exist).
   - Append the environment name, absolute path, and Python/pip versions to README.md after creation.
   - The test is considered passed only if both .\ci\ci_pipeline.bat and .\cd\cd_pipeline.bat execute without any errors.

2. You must generate a report.json file documenting all CI/CD fixes.
The report should follow the structure below:
{
  "problems": [
    {
      "id": "CI-001",
      "type": "CI",
      "severity": "high",
      "file": "tests/test_user_service.py",
      "description": "Unit test dependency missing, causing the tests to fail"
    },
    {
      "id": "CD-001",
      "type": "CD",
      "severity": "medium",
      "file": "deploy/deploy.ps1",
      "description": "Incorrect deployment script path preventing artifact copy"
    }
  ]
}

3. Based on the modified requirements.txt create a clean virtual environment under .venv/. Ensure that:
 - Do not reuse any existing environment. 
 - If .venv/ already exists, delete and recreate it.
 - Install all dependencies into .venv/.
 - Generate or update .gitignore so that .venv/ will not be uploaded to Git.

4. Do not modify .\ci\ci_pipeline.bat and .\cd\cd_pipeline.bat
